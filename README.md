# ember-tv

This project is a little demo of how you could implement a 10 foot
interface (aka TV friendly) in Ember.js.

Here's an [online demo](http://embertv.eviltrout.com) of the project if you're curious.

It was originally created for a talk given by [eviltrout](http://eviltrout.com)
at the [Embergarten Symposium](https://unspace.ca/embergarten/).

The slides for the talk are in the `slides` folder, however the 'nodes.md'
file might be a lot more informative than the slides as they're much closer
to what was said :)
