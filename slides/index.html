# What kind of app *aren't* you building?
---
# Examples of Browser Applications

# Browsers are **Everywhere**

* Tablets

* TVs

* Wearables
---
# The Theory

* Ember is great for writing browser applications

* A TV can run a browser application

* Ember is great for writing TV applications
---
# How to Run it?

* Laptop or Desktop hooked up to TV

* Cheaper options like Chromecast
---
# How are TV applications made?

* Most are native for their set top boxes

* Best case use an App Store model for delivery

# How-To in Ember

* `ember new tv-app`

* Use large fonts + full screen CSS

* Create routes for your application's state
---
# Accepting Remote Control Input

* Just think of them as keyboard commands

* We can use focus events to select controls

* But what about directional input?
---
# Ember Components to the Rescue

* Use a base class `RemoteTarget`

* Listen for Keyboard events in `ApplicationView`

* Find the closest `RemoteTarget`

* Call `focus()` on it
---
# Build up Widgets

* Demo app has a list of `{{tv-button}}`s
---
# Other fun Stuff

* Liquid Fire for Animations

* Web Audio for navigation sounds
